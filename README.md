# Project Name: Stroke Analysis using Pytorch

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict stroke occurrences using neural network implemented with PyTorch. By examining features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and other relevant medical history, we aim to develop robust models for early prediction and better management of stroke risk.

## Notebook Summary

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Comprehensive data manipulation and analysis have been performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Data Visualization**: The dataset has been visualized using various plots to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset has been preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training**: PyTorch based neural network models has also been used.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models has been shown.
